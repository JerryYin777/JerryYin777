## Hi thereï¼ˆUpdate in 12.31ï¼‰ ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a junior Undergraduate Student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in computer science at College of Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota Twins Cities.

My research interests lie in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and their application in diverse practical scenarios, such as biological and system large models. My focus also extends to developing efficient machine learning systems aimed at expediting the training and inference processing of LMMs (especially LLMs), leveraging expertise in high-performance computing and distributed systems.

Before transferring to the University of Minnesota, I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with School Special Scholarship. I was honored to be advised by Professor [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/Pages/Professor.html) at [GOOD LAB](https://good.ncu.edu.cn) starting from March 2022, where my focus was on addressing data-centric challenges and building efficient and dependable systems.

Let's Accelerate!
