## Hi there 👋

🤓 I'm JerryYin 骢睿, an undergraduate sophomore in Nanchang University majoring in artificial intelligence,working in [Generic Operational and Optimal Data Group](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/index.html) and here is my [personal lab page](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/~YinCR/).

My supervisor is [Zichen Xu](https://good.ncu.edu.cn/Pages/Professor.html) aka Frank,he is an excellent expert in the area of computing system design in the development of providing sustainable data services in unreliable/unstable systems.

I researched in NLP in the field of BERT optimization(Early Exit) and Federated learning in security,mainly on problems of unreliable the Byzantine Generals Problem.Now,I decide to do some engineering work(RISC-V)on hardware like SoC and FPGA.

I love photography 📷, traveling ✈️,and gaming😄.
