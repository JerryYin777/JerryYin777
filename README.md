#### News

<strong style="color:red;"><strong>I’m actively looking for Machine Learning System and O1/MLLM/LLM Industrial/Research Opportunity.</strong></strong> If you need a reliable teammate who is familiar with <strong style="color:red;"><strong>both NLP and computer systems </strong></strong> with <strong style="color:red;"><strong>extensive industry experiences</strong></strong>, feel free to Contact Me!


#### Biography

My name is Jerry Yin. I am currently a senior Undergraduate Student pursuing a bachelor's Degree in computer science at College of Liberal Arts, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, supervised by Prof. [Zirui Liu](https://zirui-ray-liu.github.io/) and [Jiayi Yuan](https://jy-yuan.github.io/) (Ph.D. Candidate). In the summer of 2023, I visited [TsinghuaNLP](https://github.com/thunlp) and conducted research under Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), where I received invaluable mentorship from [Weilin Zhao](https://brawny-college-5b2.notion.site/Weilin-Zhao-11d20b7deb8280388213d5f5ed072992) (Ph.D. Candidate) and [Xu Han](https://thucsthanxu13.github.io/) (Research Assistant Professor), for which I am deeply grateful.

I have experience in NLP and computer systems(both architecture and high performance machine learning systems), along with extensive industry research internship experience. This includes:

* Participating in the pretraining of the Yi-Lightning model at 01.AI.
* Contributing to ML Infra of the pretraining of the foundation model at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP).
* Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab).

#### Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI (<strong style="color:red;"><strong>Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra</strong></strong>), this includes:

1. <strong><strong>Machine Learning System</strong></strong> 
    * Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, example includes [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
    * Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. example includes [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf). 
    * Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. <strong><strong>LLM & LLM applications</strong></strong> 
    * CodeLLM
    * Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
    * RAG (GraphRAG): Examples includes [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper).

#### Misc

* Before transferring to the University of Minnesota, I studied at Nanchang University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence in a top-tier class with a School Academic Special Scholarship. I was the leader of Nanchang University Supercomputer Cluster Team ([NCUSCC](https://ncuscc.github.io/)) Leader, with experience of ASC22 and SC23(IndySCC). 

* I am passionate about open source and firmly believe in its potential to disseminate knowledge widely, leverage technology to lead innovation to the world and contribute to the advancement of human society. I am proud to have garnered over **4k stars** and acquired over **370 followers** on [GitHub](https://github.com/JerryYin777). I occasionally share my explorations in the machine learning system and LLM field on [![知乎](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E7%9F%A5%E4%B9%8E-%231E2A2A?style=for-the-badge&logo=zhihu&logoColor=blue)](https://www.zhihu.com/people/ycr222/posts) in Mandarin.

* I love league of legends and valorant games!

#### Contact<p id="contact-info"></p>

* </strong></strong>I am very enthusiastic about discussing academic issues or any interesting project-related topics! </strong></strong> If you'd like to engage in a discussion or collaborate, feel free to contact me via email at any time. 

* If you're an undergraduate student feeling uncertain, especially from a diverse background, and hope to gain some learning experiences from me, I also warmly welcome that!
